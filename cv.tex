Embedded Software Engineer Intern\newline{}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=-15pt, itemsep=0pt, topsep=1pt]
    \item Co-lead project to act as ``Embedded Software specialists'' assisting Control Systems team
    \item Proposing, implementing, and testing changes in Simulink models for various complex control algorithms, with the objective to generate more efficient C code
    \item Identified possibility to automate a Simulink optimisation, created a custom MATLAB tool as the feature was not supported by MathWorks
    \item Improved Processor In the Loop (PIL) testing pipeline by implementing software to utilise USB On-The-Go interface, instead of previous limited UART USB connection
    \item Provided detailed documentation of MATLAB tool, changes to PIL pipeline, as well as Wiki pages explaining how better code was generated, for Control Systems team\newline{}
\end{itemize}

\cventry{2023 -- 2024}{Simple Shell Project}{University of Strathclyde}{}{}{
2\textsuperscript{nd} Year Operating Systems Class: Group Assignment\newline{}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=-15pt, itemsep=0pt, topsep=1pt]
    \item Building a simple shell for Unix-type system in C
    \item First exposure to C, Linux, and GCC tools, as well as CPU processes and threads, memory management, and other such OS conecepts
    \item Challenge of this project lead me to develop my understanding of C further, eventually leading to an interest in C++ and Embedded Systems
    \item Also lead to selecting Microcontroller classes through my 3\textsuperscript{rd} and 4\textsuperscript{th} year, further developing my C++ and assembly skills
