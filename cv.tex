\section{Experience}
\subsection{Extra-Curricular}
\cventry{2025}{FPGA Development Summer Internship}{Thales}{Govan, Scotland}{}{TODO\newline{}}
\cventry{2023--present}{Formula Student FS-AI}{University of Strathclyde Motorsport}{}{}{Active member of the University of Strathclyde's Formula Student team \textbf{USM}, specifically the Formula Student AI (FS-AI) team.\newline{}\newline{}
In 2023/24, my first year in the team, I played a roll in leading the team to compete the the Formula Student UK Driverless competition for the first time in the team's history. This allowed me to improve many skills valuable to working in industry that my course otherwise would not.\newline{}\newline{}
Development of our software involved many tools and languages I had previously been unexperienced with, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) Framework
    \item CAN Interfacing in C++
    \item Docker Containers
    \item Interconnected Software Systems
    \item Foxglove \& Dynamic Bicycle Physics Simulation\newline{}
\end{itemize}
Then, moving into the 2024/25 academic year, I led the development of a new automated testing system for our software, which utilised many new tools avaliable to the team that year, such as GitLab's CI and Cloud Hosting systems. This furthered my Docker and GitLab skillset, as well as leading the way for my application for Software Infrastructure System Head in the Driverless team\newline{}

\cventry{2022--2025}{Kitchen Porter}{The Boarding House}{Howwood, Scotland}{}{Member of kitchen staff for a popular Gastropub in Howwood.\newline{}\newline{}Employment here has developed my time management skills, as well as often dealing with responsibility for customer food presentation in a fast-paced environment.\newline{}}
\cventry{2016--2024}{Bagpiper}{Johnstone Pipe Band}{Johnstone, Scotland}{}{Playing member of Johnstone Pipe Band (JPB).\newline{}\newline{}Playing for the Renfrewshire Schools Pipe Band, the novice branch of JPB at the time, before being promoted straight to the top level band (Grade 1) has taught me crucial skills for being a good team member, responsibility for putting in work in my own time, and general dicipline with the instrument as well as personal appearance\newline{}\newline{}}

\subsection{Curricular}
\cventry{2023--2024}{FPGA Design Project}{University of Strathclyde}{}{}{2\textsuperscript{nd} Year VHDL Class: Group Assignment\newline{}\newline{}
One of my 2\textsuperscript{nd} year university modules was centered around VHDL programming and FPGA implementation. For the final assignment for this class, we were assigned a group design project; to design and implement a solution for a set task, collect our design process and implementation in a professional report, and demonstrate our solution.\newline{}\newline{}
This class was my first introduction to such FPGA programming, while also allowing me to develop further my teamwork and report writing skills. The limitations present in describing hardware with VHDL proved very challenging at first, but sparked my intrest in FPGA development, leading to me seeking out such a summer internship for 2025.\newline{}\newline{}
}
\cventry{2023--2024}{Simple Shell Project}{University of Strathclyde}{}{}{2\textsuperscript{nd} Year Operating Systems Class: Group Assignment\newline{}\newline{}
Another group project completed in my 2\textsuperscript{nd} year was developing a simple OS shell in C for a Unix-type system. This was my first experience with both C and Linux development, but the challenges it presented motivated me to work harder to understand the concepts.\newline{}\newline{}
Through this I gained valuable knowledge about operating systems, such as processing, thread, and memory management, scheduling, and many such OS concepts.\newline{}\newline{}
This class led to my personal (partial) adoption of using Linux, mainly for further C software development, as well as discovering my interest in Embedded / Microcontroller development. This then resulting in my selection of 3\textsuperscript{rd} and 4\textsuperscript{th} year Microcontroller classes, and again leading me to seek out a summer internship in the field of Embedded systems for 2025.\newline{}\newline{}
